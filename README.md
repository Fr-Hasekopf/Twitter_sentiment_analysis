## Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Practice Problem
In this practice project, we focus on NLP techniques (especially sentiment analysis methods). Our task is to classify a set of tweets into two categories:  
⋅⋅*racist/sexist  
⋅⋅*non-racist/sexist  
  
Data used for this project can be found [here.](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-twitter-sentiment-analysis/)

Details and results are presented in the Jupyter Notebook.   
  
The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. Particularly, we determine that a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it.  
The evaluation metric from this practice problem is `F1-Score`.
